<p>You and the Company each further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in your respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and you and the Company each expressly waive your respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.  If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in Section 12(B) shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
